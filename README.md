# Selinium_testing
Automated testing using selenium  
This test plan outlines the testing approach for the IMDb website using Selenium IDE. It is a Level 1 Test Plan focused on verifying core IMDb functionalities such as search, navigation, login, and watchlist management. The objective is to ensure the platform works seamlessly across different browsers and operating systems.  

The plan includes functional and integration tests aligned with the IMDb Web Application Project Plan, with testing resources and tools provided within budget constraints. Testing will focus on user-facing features, excluding backend or third-party service integrations.
Any changes to the plan will follow the change control process, and communication will be coordinated with the development team to ensure timely issue resolution.
